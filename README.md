**Key Highlights of the Project:**

🔍 **Data Exploration:** I started by thoroughly understanding the dataset, checking for missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the variables and their relationships.

💡 Data Visualization: It helps me to visualize every column deeply. Seeing what is the correlation between various numeric variables, what is the hourly rate concerning department and overtime, gender count, department count, and many more.

🔎 Libraries: I've utilized various Python libraries to do this task i.e. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib & Seaborn.

📰 Charts: I've used charts like Heatmap to see the correlation between numeric variables, a count plot to see the distribution of categorical variables, and a line plot to visualize the trend.
